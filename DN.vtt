00:02:11.360 --> 00:02:13.440
Hah! I win.

00:02:13.440 --> 00:02:14.980
Don't hold it against me.

00:02:15.530 --> 00:02:18.320
Hey, Ryuk, wanna join us?

00:02:18.660 --> 00:02:20.910
Come hang out with us 
for a change.

00:02:23.580 --> 00:02:26.000
No, I'll pass.

00:02:28.410 --> 00:02:30.880
Listen for the voice of God

00:02:30.880 --> 00:02:32.420
and never guess you will...

00:02:32.420 --> 00:02:35.800
I didn't do a thing, but he still got upset...

00:02:35.800 --> 00:02:36.960
Really? And then?

00:02:36.960 --> 00:02:39.220
Yagami, what's the matter?

00:02:39.220 --> 00:02:42.550
Please translate the following sentences.

00:02:46.970 --> 00:02:49.440
Follow the voice of God.

00:02:49.440 --> 00:02:52.810
Then the blessings of the sea will become bountiful

00:02:53.520 --> 00:02:55.530
and there will be no storms.

00:02:56.650 --> 00:03:00.910
Today, at approximately 11 a.m. 
in Kanagawa Prefecture in Yokohama,

00:03:00.910 --> 00:03:05.540
the body of a man appearing to be about 30 years old 
was found in an apartment, covered in blood.

00:03:05.540 --> 00:03:08.450
Kanagawa Police have opened a homicide investigation.

00:03:08.450 --> 00:03:09.830
In other news...

00:03:10.460 --> 00:03:13.750
Today, shortly after noon, 
in the Shibuya district of Tokyo,

00:03:13.750 --> 00:03:18.210
a 25-year-old woman was gagged and killed by her live-in partner.

00:03:18.210 --> 00:03:23.510
35-year-old Tofuji Naoki is being 
held in custody charged with her murder.

00:03:24.600 --> 00:03:26.640
Day in and day out...

00:03:27.770 --> 00:03:30.440
the same thing over and over again.

00:03:31.770 --> 00:03:33.350
Jeez...

00:03:33.350 --> 00:03:35.190
It's so ridiculous.

00:03:36.110 --> 00:03:39.650
This world...

00:03:37.650 --> 00:03:39.650
...is rotten.

00:03:39.650 --> 00:03:42.660
Rebirth

00:03:43.240 --> 00:03:49.450
Another is the extinction of many species of life on the planet.

00:03:47.490 --> 00:03:49.750
No way! You went to see that?

00:03:49.450 --> 00:03:54.750
Species are becoming extinct 
at a faster rate than has occurred...

00:03:49.750 --> 00:03:51.330
It was a complete waste of time.

00:03:51.330 --> 00:03:53.080
I should've asked for a refund!

00:03:53.080 --> 00:03:54.750
Well, you <i>did</i> watch it.

00:04:29.700 --> 00:04:31.160
Death Note?

00:04:31.870 --> 00:04:33.920
Literally translated as "a notebook of death."

00:04:37.000 --> 00:04:38.880
How to use it...

00:04:38.880 --> 00:04:42.880
The human whose name is written in this note...

00:04:42.880 --> 00:04:44.050
shall die?

00:04:46.470 --> 00:04:47.680
What a joke...

00:04:48.720 --> 00:04:51.640
This is so sick.

00:04:51.640 --> 00:04:55.980
It's no different than a chain letter.

00:04:55.980 --> 00:04:58.820
"The human whose name is written in this note shall die?" C'mon.

00:05:08.740 --> 00:05:12.040
Seriously... I must be going insane.

00:05:15.500 --> 00:05:19.460
There will be no effect when the face of 
the targetted person is not in the writer's mind.

00:05:19.460 --> 00:05:20.170
Therefore,

00:05:20.170 --> 00:05:24.470
people sharing the same name will not be affected.

00:05:24.470 --> 00:05:29.350
If the cause of death is written within 
40 seconds of writing the person's name,

00:05:29.350 --> 00:05:31.060
it will happen as it is written.

00:05:31.060 --> 00:05:34.520
If the cause of death is not specified, 
the person will simply die of a heart attack.

00:05:34.980 --> 00:05:37.770
After writing the cause of death, 
in the next 6 minutes and 40 seconds,

00:05:37.770 --> 00:05:41.270
details of the death should be written.

00:05:43.190 --> 00:05:46.950
So you can let people die peacefully or make them suffer.

00:05:47.280 --> 00:05:51.080
A prank this intricate isn't too bad, I guess.

00:05:58.040 --> 00:06:00.920
Write their name and they die, huh?

00:06:02.040 --> 00:06:03.750
This is so stupid!

00:06:19.600 --> 00:06:20.810
Wait a minute.

00:06:20.810 --> 00:06:24.280
If someone actually dies, 
does that make me a murderer?

00:06:26.320 --> 00:06:29.450
No way. It'd never happen.

00:06:30.240 --> 00:06:34.450
The assailant who killed six people yesterday at a busy shopping district in Shinjuku

00:06:34.450 --> 00:06:39.870
has now taken eight people hostage,
 including children and teachers, in this daycare center.

00:06:39.870 --> 00:06:44.050
The police have now identified the suspect as 42-year-old Otoharada Kurou, unemployed.

00:06:41.170 --> 00:06:44.050

00:06:44.460 --> 00:06:46.260
The police will begin negotiations with the suspect.

00:06:48.550 --> 00:06:50.640
Otoharada Kurou

00:06:53.010 --> 00:06:55.060
A heart attack in 40 seconds,

00:06:55.390 --> 00:06:56.850
right?

00:06:58.140 --> 00:07:00.520
Well, that is not clear at the moment.

00:07:01.400 --> 00:07:04.110
You can't help but be worried for the hostages right now.

00:07:04.110 --> 00:07:05.270
Absolutely.

00:07:05.270 --> 00:07:07.820
This has been a report from the scene.

00:07:07.820 --> 00:07:09.320
Thank you very much.

00:07:10.030 --> 00:07:11.610
What do you think, Mr. Hashimoto?

00:07:11.610 --> 00:07:15.660
Well, I'm hoping for a quick resolution to this.

00:07:17.120 --> 00:07:19.540
Oh well, nothing happened.

00:07:19.540 --> 00:07:21.580
What did I expect?

00:07:23.250 --> 00:07:24.500
Just a minute.

00:07:25.090 --> 00:07:26.420
There seems to be something happening.

00:07:26.880 --> 00:07:28.130
The hostages are coming out!

00:07:28.630 --> 00:07:29.800
They all seem to be fine!

00:07:29.800 --> 00:07:32.340
And now it looks like the SWAT team is entering!

00:07:32.340 --> 00:07:34.010
Has the suspect been arrested?!

00:07:35.220 --> 00:07:36.010
Yes!

00:07:36.010 --> 00:07:40.270
We just received word that the suspect has died inside the daycare center!

00:07:40.770 --> 00:07:42.650
The suspect is dead!

00:07:42.980 --> 00:07:43.980
Dead?!

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.020
Otoharada

00:07:43.980 --> 00:07:46.020
Kurou

00:07:46.020 --> 00:07:49.900
The police are strongly denying that they shot the suspect!

00:07:49.900 --> 00:07:53.660
Then could he have felt cornered and committed suicide?

00:07:53.660 --> 00:07:57.790
According to one of the hostages, 
"The suspect just suddenly collapsed."

00:07:57.790 --> 00:07:59.290
A heart attack...

00:08:01.910 --> 00:08:03.460
N-No way...

00:08:03.870 --> 00:08:05.380
This is a coincidence.

00:08:05.380 --> 00:08:07.000
It's gotta be a coincidence!

00:08:07.460 --> 00:08:08.630
Light!

00:08:09.710 --> 00:08:11.970
It's almost 6:30.

00:08:11.970 --> 00:08:14.260
Don't you have cram school tonight?

00:08:14.260 --> 00:08:16.720
Yeah, I'm getting ready now.

00:08:17.720 --> 00:08:18.890
The Death Note...

00:08:19.180 --> 00:08:22.440
It's a long shot, but if this is the real thing,

00:08:22.440 --> 00:08:25.310
it's worth testing once more.

00:08:26.020 --> 00:08:28.480
In which case, the victim should probably be a criminal.

00:08:28.980 --> 00:08:31.610
But it can't be someone too infamous.

00:08:31.610 --> 00:08:36.240
If they die, it's possible that 
their deaths will be covered up.

00:08:36.240 --> 00:08:38.200
I need an immediate result.

00:08:39.240 --> 00:08:40.580
Hey, Ryo baby!

00:08:40.580 --> 00:08:42.710
Wh-What is it, Sudou?

00:08:42.710 --> 00:08:44.670
Lend me 'bout 2,000 yen, will ya?

00:08:44.670 --> 00:08:46.830
Wh-What? Again?

00:08:46.830 --> 00:08:48.290
Sudou...

00:08:47.880 --> 00:08:49.250
What? You refusing?

00:08:48.290 --> 00:08:49.250
Shall I kill him?

00:08:50.340 --> 00:08:54.300
No, I'd better avoid people I know.

00:08:55.130 --> 00:08:55.760
No...

00:08:56.510 --> 00:08:59.140
Why should I worry?

00:08:59.140 --> 00:09:01.470
If one or two people like him were to die,

00:09:01.470 --> 00:09:04.310
not a single soul would care.

00:09:04.310 --> 00:09:07.230
Now we can go to the arcade after school.

00:09:08.190 --> 00:09:10.860
Maki, wanna party with some guys tomorrow?

00:09:10.860 --> 00:09:11.980
Absolutely!

00:09:11.980 --> 00:09:13.740
Hey, me too!

00:09:13.740 --> 00:09:15.700
Dammit, that stupid old hag!

00:09:15.700 --> 00:09:17.910
She's not here to pick me up!

00:09:18.990 --> 00:09:20.370
It's sickening.

00:09:20.370 --> 00:09:22.830
Every single one of them...

00:09:22.830 --> 00:09:26.790
I'd do society a favor 
by killing them.

00:09:28.540 --> 00:09:30.040
Hey girl!

00:09:31.300 --> 00:09:33.670
Fancy having some fun with us?

00:09:33.670 --> 00:09:36.550
Hey, Taku! You've got a beauty there!

00:09:37.300 --> 00:09:40.680
I'm Shibuimaru Takuo. Shibutaku, for short.

00:09:41.810 --> 00:09:44.770
Hang out with us for a while, baby.

00:09:44.770 --> 00:09:46.390
I-I don't think so.

00:09:46.390 --> 00:09:47.480
She doesn't think so!

00:09:47.480 --> 00:09:49.980
How cute!

00:09:54.320 --> 00:09:56.400
C'mon, grab her. 
Get those clothes off!

00:09:56.400 --> 00:09:57.990
Can we?!

00:09:59.280 --> 00:10:00.660
Stop!

00:10:00.660 --> 00:10:02.120
Please!

00:10:02.120 --> 00:10:04.040
Stop!

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.960


00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.960
tL NoTe

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.960
|

00:10:06.330 --> 00:10:08.960
All the different variations of writing the name "Shibuimaru Takuo."

00:10:08.960 --> 00:10:10.040
Now let's see...

00:10:10.420 --> 00:10:11.500
what'll happen!

00:10:14.210 --> 00:10:15.010
Hey, wait!

00:10:15.010 --> 00:10:16.090
Taku! Watch out!

00:10:23.060 --> 00:10:25.020
This... This settles it!

00:10:25.890 --> 00:10:28.560
The Death Note is real!

00:10:29.060 --> 00:10:30.350
Taku!

00:10:30.350 --> 00:10:31.770
I-Idiot!

00:10:31.770 --> 00:10:33.440
He just jumped out in front of me.

00:10:37.110 --> 00:10:38.570
I guess...

00:10:38.570 --> 00:10:40.990
I'd better get going.

00:10:53.750 --> 00:10:55.550
It's been five days since then.

00:10:56.300 --> 00:10:57.590
I guess...

00:10:57.590 --> 00:10:59.550
I'd better get going.

00:10:59.550 --> 00:11:02.090
Huh? Going out, Ryuk?

00:11:02.550 --> 00:11:05.180
This place is barren everywhere you go.

00:11:07.310 --> 00:11:09.480
I dropped my Death Note.

00:11:10.940 --> 00:11:13.400
You really messed up big time!

00:11:13.400 --> 00:11:17.480
Hey, weren't you carrying around 
a second one behind the old man's back?

00:11:17.480 --> 00:11:19.490
Don't tell me you lost both of 'em?

00:11:19.860 --> 00:11:22.450
Do ya even know where ya dropped it?

00:11:23.200 --> 00:11:24.370
The Human World.

00:11:24.370 --> 00:11:25.740
What?!

00:11:55.730 --> 00:11:56.770
Welcome home.

00:11:56.770 --> 00:11:59.070
You're home early, Light.

00:11:59.070 --> 00:11:59.940
Yeah.

00:12:00.740 --> 00:12:03.200
I'm back, Mom.

00:12:03.200 --> 00:12:03.860
Huh?

00:12:05.570 --> 00:12:08.540
Oh, you want the results of 
the national mock entrance exams?

00:12:08.540 --> 00:12:10.120
Hurry!

00:12:10.750 --> 00:12:12.120
Here you go.

00:12:12.120 --> 00:12:14.540
Goodness! Number one again!

00:12:14.540 --> 00:12:16.590
You really did your best, Light!

00:12:16.590 --> 00:12:17.840
Well, yeah.

00:12:17.840 --> 00:12:20.590
I'll be studying, so don't bother me.

00:12:20.590 --> 00:12:21.840
All right.

00:12:21.840 --> 00:12:23.340
Oh, Light...

00:12:23.340 --> 00:12:25.220
Do you want anything?

00:12:25.220 --> 00:12:26.890
Anything at all?

00:12:26.890 --> 00:12:29.100
Not really, Mom.

00:12:32.060 --> 00:12:34.350
I already have what I want.

00:12:53.330 --> 00:12:55.000
You seem to like it.

00:13:02.720 --> 00:13:05.300
Why are you shocked?

00:13:05.300 --> 00:13:09.560
The one who dropped that notebook was me, Ryuk, a Shinigami.

00:13:09.560 --> 00:13:11.020
From what I just saw,

00:13:11.640 --> 00:13:15.140
you're already aware that that's no ordinary notebook.

00:13:21.480 --> 00:13:22.860
A Shinigami, huh?

00:13:27.110 --> 00:13:29.660
I'm not shocked, Ryuk.

00:13:30.450 --> 00:13:31.540
In fact,

00:13:32.120 --> 00:13:34.660
I've been waiting for you, Ryuk.

00:13:35.210 --> 00:13:36.540
Oh?

00:13:36.830 --> 00:13:42.130
I didn't think the Shinigami's Notebook was real,

00:13:42.130 --> 00:13:44.260
but after seeing its results,

00:13:44.630 --> 00:13:47.430
I can act with certainty.

00:13:47.930 --> 00:13:49.760
I see.

00:13:49.760 --> 00:13:51.850
You really surprise me.

00:13:52.310 --> 00:13:58.310
I've heard of Death Notes getting down 
to the Human World a few times before.

00:13:58.850 --> 00:14:02.780
But you're the first one to use it to this extent in just five days.

00:14:02.780 --> 00:14:05.070
Most people would be too scared to try it out.

00:14:05.740 --> 00:14:08.110
I'm prepared, Ryuk.

00:14:08.110 --> 00:14:11.490
I used a Death Note knowing it belonged to a Shinigami.

00:14:11.490 --> 00:14:13.080
And now the Shinigami's here.

00:14:13.790 --> 00:14:15.330
So what'll happen to me?

00:14:15.330 --> 00:14:17.370
Are you going to take my soul?

00:14:17.370 --> 00:14:19.880
Huh? What's that about?

00:14:19.880 --> 00:14:22.420
Some fantasy you humans came up with?

00:14:23.340 --> 00:14:25.590
I'm not going to do anything to you.

00:14:26.920 --> 00:14:29.390
Once the Death Note lands in the Human World,

00:14:29.390 --> 00:14:31.720
it belongs to the Human World.

00:14:31.720 --> 00:14:33.600
In other words,

00:14:33.600 --> 00:14:35.140
it belongs to you.

00:14:35.600 --> 00:14:37.310
It belongs to me?

00:14:38.100 --> 00:14:40.900
If you don't want it, give it to some other human.

00:14:40.900 --> 00:14:44.980
But if you do that, all memory of 
the Death Note will be erased from your mind.

00:14:45.650 --> 00:14:48.900
So using the Death Note

00:14:48.900 --> 00:14:50.240
doesn't come with a catch?

00:14:50.780 --> 00:14:52.660
Well, if anything, there is...

00:14:52.660 --> 00:14:56.790
only the fear and pain humans who 
have used the Death Note will experience.

00:14:58.290 --> 00:15:00.330
And when you die,

00:15:00.670 --> 00:15:05.130
it falls to me to write your name in my Death Note.

00:15:06.090 --> 00:15:08.590
Don't think for a moment, that any human

00:15:08.590 --> 00:15:11.720
who's used the Death Note can go to Heaven, or Hell.

00:15:13.140 --> 00:15:14.390
That's all.

00:15:19.230 --> 00:15:21.770
You'll find out about it after you die.

00:15:25.690 --> 00:15:27.030
Light...

00:15:27.030 --> 00:15:28.320
Don't worry.

00:15:28.320 --> 00:15:29.320
Answer her.

00:15:32.110 --> 00:15:32.910
What?

00:15:32.910 --> 00:15:34.700
I brought some apples.

00:15:34.700 --> 00:15:36.830
They're from our neighbors.

00:15:36.830 --> 00:15:39.000
Why is it so dark in there?

00:15:39.290 --> 00:15:41.040
You'll ruin your eyesight!

00:15:40.580 --> 00:15:41.710
What's going on?

00:15:41.040 --> 00:15:41.710
Geez.

00:15:42.210 --> 00:15:44.500
Mom can't see him?

00:15:45.790 --> 00:15:49.800
That notebook originally 
belonged to me.

00:15:49.800 --> 00:15:52.510
And since you're the one using it,

00:15:52.510 --> 00:15:55.140
only you can see me.

00:15:55.140 --> 00:15:56.350
Of course, my voice...

00:15:56.350 --> 00:15:58.180
Only you can hear it.

00:15:58.180 --> 00:15:59.390
In other words, the Death Note

00:15:59.890 --> 00:16:03.020
is a bond between Light the human and Ryuk the Shinigami.

00:16:07.270 --> 00:16:08.030
Tasty.

00:16:08.480 --> 00:16:10.280
Let me ask you one more thing.

00:16:10.990 --> 00:16:12.990
Why did you choose me?

00:16:14.070 --> 00:16:15.450
Hey, are you listening?

00:16:18.700 --> 00:16:21.790
Apples in the Human World are awesome.

00:16:21.790 --> 00:16:23.420
What would you call them?

00:16:24.040 --> 00:16:24.670
Juicy?

00:16:24.670 --> 00:16:26.250
Answer my question.

00:16:27.420 --> 00:16:29.050
I didn't choose you.

00:16:29.050 --> 00:16:31.880
I just dropped the notebook.

00:16:31.880 --> 00:16:35.010
Did you think you were chosen because you were smart?

00:16:35.010 --> 00:16:36.050
Don't flatter yourself.

00:16:37.260 --> 00:16:40.720
It just happened to fall around here and you just happened to pick it up.

00:16:40.720 --> 00:16:42.430
That's all.

00:16:43.060 --> 00:16:47.400
That's why I wrote the explanation in English, 
the most popular language in the Human World.

00:16:47.690 --> 00:16:49.650
Then why did you drop it?!

00:16:49.650 --> 00:16:53.950
Don't tell me it was by mistake after you went to the trouble and wrote all those instructions.

00:16:54.610 --> 00:16:56.110
Why'd I drop it?

00:16:56.870 --> 00:16:58.950
Because I was bored.

00:17:00.040 --> 00:17:01.450
Bored?

00:17:03.040 --> 00:17:06.120
The truth is that Shinigami these days have a lot of time on their hands.

00:17:06.120 --> 00:17:08.960
They're either taking a nap or gambling.

00:17:09.960 --> 00:17:12.760
If others see you studiously scribbling names in the Death Note,

00:17:12.760 --> 00:17:15.470
they'll say, "What are you working so hard for?" and laugh at you.

00:17:16.300 --> 00:17:19.720
Writing names of other Shinigami doesn't work.

00:17:19.720 --> 00:17:22.140
But since we live in the Shinigami Realm,

00:17:22.140 --> 00:17:25.980
it's no fun at all to kill people who live in the Human World!

00:17:27.270 --> 00:17:31.190
So I figured it'd be more fun to come down here myself.

00:17:32.820 --> 00:17:36.280
But you sure wrote a lotta names.

00:17:36.280 --> 00:17:40.780
But why'd you write down the cause of death only for that guy who was hit by the truck?

00:17:41.160 --> 00:17:44.750
Without the cause of death written down, 
they all die of heart attacks.

00:17:44.750 --> 00:17:48.040
That's the best thing about the Death Note, Ryuk.

00:17:49.840 --> 00:17:53.260
I can write down the names of the criminals

00:17:53.260 --> 00:17:55.630
and slowly reduce the number of evil people.

00:17:55.630 --> 00:17:57.430
What's the point?

00:17:57.800 --> 00:18:02.430
Any fool can figure it out if someone is just "eliminating the bad guys."

00:18:03.020 --> 00:18:06.020
I want the world to know of my existence!

00:18:06.600 --> 00:18:09.400
That there is someone passing judgment on them!

00:18:11.730 --> 00:18:16.280
But what's the point in passing judgment?

00:18:16.280 --> 00:18:17.570
Why do it?

00:18:18.740 --> 00:18:20.410
I, too,

00:18:20.410 --> 00:18:22.120
was bored.

00:18:24.700 --> 00:18:27.040
Naturally, I didn't believe it at first.

00:18:27.040 --> 00:18:28.790
But that Death Note

00:18:28.790 --> 00:18:33.090
has the supernatural power to tempt people 
to want to try it at least once.

00:18:34.630 --> 00:18:37.090
I... I killed them.

00:18:37.670 --> 00:18:38.930
Two men...

00:18:39.510 --> 00:18:41.350
I killed them!

00:18:42.800 --> 00:18:44.220
Human lives...

00:18:44.220 --> 00:18:46.310
shouldn't be taken so lightly!

00:18:46.310 --> 00:18:49.850
Do I have the right 
to judge people like that?

00:18:52.060 --> 00:18:53.230
No...

00:18:53.230 --> 00:18:54.860
I'm not wrong!

00:18:54.860 --> 00:18:57.070
I've always thought about this.

00:18:57.070 --> 00:18:58.740
The world is rotten!

00:18:59.240 --> 00:19:01.740
Rotten people deserve to die!

00:19:02.410 --> 00:19:03.580
Someone...

00:19:03.580 --> 00:19:06.500
Someone has to do it!

00:19:06.500 --> 00:19:10.040
Even if it means sacrificing 
one's conscience and life!

00:19:10.040 --> 00:19:13.250
Things can't stay like this!

00:19:13.920 --> 00:19:17.090
If the Death Note had fallen into someone else's hands,

00:19:17.550 --> 00:19:21.180
would they have had the resolve 
to erase unwanted people from this world?

00:19:21.180 --> 00:19:23.100
No way!

00:19:23.100 --> 00:19:24.930
But I...

00:19:24.970 --> 00:19:26.310
I can do it!

00:19:27.600 --> 00:19:28.930
In fact,

00:19:28.930 --> 00:19:31.230
only I can do it!

00:19:31.230 --> 00:19:33.810
And I will! With the Death Note!

00:19:34.980 --> 00:19:36.780
I'll change the world!

00:20:14.270 --> 00:20:16.570
At first I kept writing the names of criminals

00:20:16.570 --> 00:20:19.230
as if I were cleaning up the world.

00:20:19.230 --> 00:20:23.320
So that in time, no one would do evil.

00:20:23.570 --> 00:20:28.540
While those guilty ones who truly deserved to be punished for their crimes die of heart attacks,

00:20:28.540 --> 00:20:32.160
people who were immoral or harass others,

00:20:32.160 --> 00:20:35.420
would slowly be erased through illness or accidents.

00:20:35.420 --> 00:20:39.840
Then the world would truly move in the right direction.

00:20:40.420 --> 00:20:46.850
And I would create a new world of earnest, kind humans.

00:20:47.300 --> 00:20:51.060
Then you'd be the only 
fucked-up person left.

00:20:51.060 --> 00:20:53.560
Huh? What are you saying?

00:20:53.560 --> 00:20:54.520
Ryuk,

00:20:54.980 --> 00:20:59.400
I'm probably the best, most diligent honor student in Japan.

00:21:01.530 --> 00:21:03.280
And I will become...

00:21:05.320 --> 00:21:07.570
the god of the new world!

00:21:09.910 --> 00:21:12.120
I knew it! Humans...

00:21:13.290 --> 00:21:14.960
sure are interesting.

00:21:23.050 --> 00:21:26.090
To be continued

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:31.600
I had a dream that no one could see

00:21:26.340 --> 00:21:31.600
dare ni mo mirenai yume o mite

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:37.020
I threw away everything that I didn't need

00:21:31.600 --> 00:21:37.020
iranai mono wa subete suteta

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:41.820
I'm holding these feelings that I can't give up in my heart

00:21:37.020 --> 00:21:41.820
yuzurenai omoi kono mune ni yadoshite

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:45.700
I'm holding these feelings that I can't give up in my heart

00:21:41.820 --> 00:21:45.700
yuzurenai omoi kono mune ni yadoshite

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:52.080
Even if my feet fall victim to the shackles of sacrifice

00:21:45.900 --> 00:21:52.080
mada real to ideal no hazama ni ite

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:57.120
In between reality and my ideal

00:21:52.290 --> 00:21:57.120
gisei no kase ni ashi o toraretemo

00:21:57.460 --> 00:22:02.130
I can't hold back the flooding impulses
